# Ant-Biomimetry
A class project for Appl 101 in 2020 Fall

In this project I used Matlab to simulate the food searching behavior of an ant nest. Program included the implementation of the full procedure of sending out ants, finding the food, calling for other ants by odor communication, and carrying food back to nest. The Ant.m file is the main file.
